# Group Contacts:
This group is Team80Fun (SwagBoys)
team80fun@gmail.com
# Goals:
1. Complete all assignments at a standard that we all find acceptable. Passing grades preferred. 
2. To learn to work as a team, and prepare us for the workplace
3. Rule Number 1...... is to have 80Fun!
## Work Norms:
1. Time Commitment required by each group member: 
Time commitment is a difficult thing to determine seeing one member may be able to complete the same job in a less amount of time. The goal is to complete the job. If one member is taking a substantial amount of time more than the others, it will be examined by the group as to whether his work load should be decreased.
# Group Rules:
## Meetings:
1. Attendance: We Understand that occasional absences can happen, and that communication outside of meetings is priority. Group will take a vote at meeting that member is not in attendance of, if disciplinary action needs to be taken. If group is fine about absentee members contribution outside of meetings, no disciplinary action is required. 
2. Time: Meetings will be held at 7:00 pm every Wednesday, in an undisclosed location. Top Secret. Thankyou. 
Meetings will be around an hour long, or however long they need to be to complete all work and branch delegation.  
4. Tardiness: Same methods as section 1 of the meetings heading to decide if any action needs to be taken. 
## Group Communication and Interaction:
1. Primary means of comunication: We will be utilizing a discord server for primary communication. [https://discord.gg/yaj44M](https://discord.gg/yaj44M)
2. Progress Notification: All GitHub Pushes and merges to master branch should be coordinated through the Discord channel to prevent issues.   
3. Communication Timleyness: Primary means of communication will be used for announcements and push/pull/merge requests, but tagged messages will have an expectation of 24 hours to respond. Repeat offenses will incur proceedings similar to those of Meeting Tardiness votes. 
## Group Participation and Work Quality:
1. Workloads will be assigned in meetings or on discord, as well as tentative deadlines. Group members (SwagBoys) will agree to workloads and deadlines and thereafter be considered accountable for them. Failure to meet deadlines will result in disciplinary actions as outlined in the disciplinary procedures section.
## Disciplinary Procedures:
1.  Group will take a vote at meeting if any disciplinary rules have been compromised. At this point disciplinary actions will be decided. If repeat offenses occur, vote on punishment and dismissal will be given over to review by TA and governing bodies. 
2. A shame role on the discord server will be given to any member who does not contribute satisfactorily. The shame role can be removed once the group member in question has proven themselves worthy. If a group member cannot free themselves from the share role they will be fired immediately following a group vote without severance.
